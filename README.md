The motivation behind our analysis of Yelp restaurant data is to explore the factors influencing customer satisfaction
and behavioral intention regarding four pivotal cuisines: Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Mexican. These cuisines
represent prominent non-American culinary traditions in the United States, deeply ingrained in the fabric of ethnic
cuisine and widely embraced by consumers. As interest in diverse culinary experiences continues to grow,
understanding the dynamics that drive preferences within these culinary categories becomes increasingly relevant.
Powell et al.'s research (2014) emphasizes the importance of considering how exposure to food advertising varies
across demographic segments. Disparities in exposure could shape food preferences and consumption patterns,
potentially impacting the popularity of specific cuisines among different racial/ethnic and income groups. However,
research by TomiÄ‡ et al. (2018) highlights the positive attitudes consumers exhibit toward ethnic food, reflecting a
broader societal trend toward embracing culinary diversity. Similarly, the study by Boch et al. (2021) suggests that as
aspects of ethnic culture assimilate into mainstream culture, the emphasis on the ethnic origins of these cuisines may
diminish.
These research findings prompt questions about the consumption patterns of popular ethnic cuisines: are they
uniformly favored across diverse demographic groups? Alternatively, could preferences be influenced by factors such
as the concentration of specific ethnicities or the appeal of distinct flavors and culinary experiences?
Our objective is to unravel the intricate interplay between demographic characteristics and restaurant attributes that
influence customer satisfaction with ethnic cuisines. Through comparative analysis of restaurant ratings for each of the
four cuisines using Yelp data, we aim to discern the factors contributing to disparities in customer satisfaction (ratings)
across these culinary categories. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to provide valuable insig
