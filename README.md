The motivation behind our analysis of Yelp restaurant data is to explore the factors influencing customer satisfaction
and behavioral intention regarding four pivotal cuisines: Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Mexican. These cuisines
represent prominent non-American culinary traditions in the United States, deeply ingrained in the fabric of ethnic
cuisine and widely embraced by consumers. As interest in diverse culinary experiences continues to grow,
understanding the dynamics that drive preferences within these culinary categories becomes increasingly relevant.
